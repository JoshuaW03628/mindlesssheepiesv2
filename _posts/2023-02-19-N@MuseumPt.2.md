# What I did at night at the museum

## What I saw

I walked through Mr.Mortensons class first and saw a bunch of people, parents, students, etc. It was cool but I was early so I walked around, I saw art, digital media, games and many other things. What I saw was all positive. No one was upset with their interaction with the teacher and all the parents had nothing but good things to say.

- this was a cool photo because it is made by someone I know and hes a Pheonix suns fan so it is funny because it relates to him.
- The colors and the design really pop
- I also hate the pheonix suns
