## Rubric

| Category | Expectation | Explanation |
| :------: | ----------- | ----------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | Describes the purpose of the program, describes the program's functionality, and can take an input and return an output. | The purpose of this program is to provide the user with an entertaining and competitive experience through the gameplay of several virtual arcade games along with the exchange of digital currency. |
| Data Abstraction | Shows how data has been stored in a collection and shows data from that collection as it contributes to the overall purpose of the program. Identifies the name of a variable representing the collection being used and describes what the data contained in the collection represents in the program. | Our program abstracts data through the creation of records that are added to a backend database. The purpose of this database is to store crucial information about a user such as the number of tokens they have. This value can be used in our program to construct a leaderboard of players with the highest number of tokens in order to create a more competitive experience. |
| Managing Complexity | Shows a collection of data that manages complexity. Explains an alternative method that would have been more complex and explains why that method could not be used or how it would have to be written differently. | There are many alternative methods and ways that our CPT could be created differently. This is because we can rearrange games and the currency, etc. |
| Procedural Abstraction | Shows a student-developed procedure with at least one parameter that has an effect on the functionality of the procedure, and shows where that procedure is called. Describes how the procedure contributes to the functionality of the program. | One specific way that this can be shown is in hi-lo. The game is called in the submenu and has an effect as one of the 4 created games to make the website function. |
| Algorithm Implementation | Includes a student-developed algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration. Explains how the algorithm works in detail enough to where someone could recreate it. | Each of the games will have some sort of algorithm implemented |
| Testing | Describe two calls to the selected procedure in response 3c. Each call must pass a argument that causes different outputs. Describes conditions being tested by each call. Identifies the result of each call. | Our Group will test two different features in each separate arcade game, these will test specific conditions and give different results. |

##  CPT

Each person in our group is creating their own specific game for the arcade, each members CPT will be focused on their respective game. This all will be incorporated into a larger project, which is the entire arcade itself.

## Code Plan

- User pays 2 coins to play 
- Every Guess the user is deducted 2 coins from 20, all the way until they guess the number
- The user will keep the sum of what they end with wether that is less than 1o or over will decide their +/-.
- The user will be brought to a play again/exit screen after each round.

## Video Plan

- I will show the creation of my account and grant of tokens then play my specific game, I will then check my rank on the leaderboard
