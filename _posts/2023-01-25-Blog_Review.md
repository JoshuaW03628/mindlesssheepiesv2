# 5.1

### Q1, Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing.

### Benefits

- Computers have enabled people to automate many tasks and processes, increasing efficiency and productivity.
- Computers have facilitated instant communication and collaboration, connecting people from all over the world.
- Computers allow for large amounts of data to be collected, processed, and analyzed, providing insights and informing decision-making.

### Harms

-  The collection and use of personal data can lead to privacy violations and the potential misuse of information.
-  The proliferation of fake news and misinformation on the internet can spread rapidly and negatively impact societies.
- Harmful: Automation has led to job displacement, as some tasks can now be performed by machines instead of people.

### Q2, Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?

-  There is evidence to suggest that certain technologies, such as social media, can affect dopamine levels and lead to addictive behavior. However, the relationship between technology and dopamine is complex and not fully understood.

- I can say that excessive use of technology can have negative impacts on student success in high school. This can include distractions from studying and sleep disturbances, as well as a decrease in face-to-face communication skills. As I have been affected by this before.

# 5.2

### Q1, How does someone empower themself in a digital world?

Empowering oneself in a digital world involves taking control of one's digital presence and maximizing its benefits while minimizing its risks. You can do this by;

- Learning about digital literacy, online privacy, and the potential risks and benefits of technology. Stay informed about new developments and trends in the digital world.

- Acquire new skills that can help you in your personal and professional life, such as coding, data analysis, or digital marketing.

- Limit your screen time, disconnect from technology regularly, and engage in activities that promote well-being.

- etc.

### Q2, How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.

- When someone is empowered, they have the knowledge, skills, and confidence to navigate and thrive in the digital world. To help someone who is not empowered, they can use their skills and resources to educate, support, and empower others.

- One thing you could do is Mentoring, offer to help someone with a specific digital skill or project, and share your knowledge and experience with them.

### Q3, Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?

- Paper and red tape can sometimes act as barriers to digital empowerment, especially in situations where government or organizational policies and procedures are not aligned with the use of technology. These barriers can take the form of regulations, restrictions on access to technology, or the lack of resources and support for digital initiatives.

- At Del Norte Specifically these barriers can include outdated technology infrastructure, limited access to technology resources, and a lack of teacher training and support for digital learning; Elsewhere would probably have similar problems.

# 5.3 Computer Bias

## Notes

- Computer Bias, only gives you 1 view as an AI, humans make mistakes and you need a broad view of topics.

### Q Google “What age groups use Facebook” vs “… TikTok”? What does the data say? Is there purposeful exclusion in these platforms? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business?

- Typically you would see an older audience using Facebook nowadays, as it is an older social media platform, specifically ages 30-50.
- In Tiktok you would typically see ages 10-19 because it is a newer search engine and gives easy access to content and more enjoyable for the younger generation than you would see on Tiktok.
- I do not believe that there is any purposeful exclusion in these platforms because the more people for the app te better for them, so I don't see why this would be the case. I believe that it is more of a generational gap and more advanced media and isn't harmful.

### Why do virtual assistants have female voices? Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri. Was this purposeful? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business?

- According to BBC.com, "you might find feminine synthesized voices to be more common than masculine ones. But why? It's partly down to the fact that companies spent decades acquiring many more recordings of women's voices than of men's." Personally I believe that the reason for the gathering of women's voices is because they are softer and more smooth.

- This is probably purposeful but I don't believe that it is harmful because at the end of the day it is an AI and there are features to switch the voices if desired. I don't believe it needs to be corrected and to me it is good business.

### Talk about an algorithm that influences your decisions, think about these companies (ie FAANG - Facebook, Amazon, Apple,Netflix, Google)

- One specific algorithm that impacts almost everyone in the modern day would be Google. It is the most widely used search engine and people rely on it for obtaining information and doing research. Based on what this engine shows, people develop opinions on it.

## Hacks

### Q1 Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?, If yes or no, justify you conclusion.

- Definitely not, he has a hint of sarcasm in his voice so you can tell hes joking. he probably understands that it was a problem with the face recognition software and not purposely implemented.

### How do you think this happened?

- HP probably only tested white people or people with lighter skin tones, so they did not recognize that their software is racist.

### Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?

- This was not harmful, it was not supposed to work like this so exclude.

### Should it be corrected?

- Most Definitely. Or else they are losing a large audience of buyers for their company.

### What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?

- Fix the software and refund people in exchange for their computer that they had already purchased.

# 5.4 CrowdSourcing

## Notes

### Q, We have all experienced Crowdsourcing by using external data through API’s, namely RapidAPI. This data has influenced how we code and shown possibilities in obtaining and analyzing data. Discuss APIs you have used.

- The only API I have come utilized is RapidAPI which I used last trimester in my Create Performance Task.

### Q, We have all participated in code Crowdsourcing by using GitHub. Many of you have forked from the Teacher repository, or exchanged code with fellow students. Not only can we analyze GitHub code, but we can obtain profiles and history about the persons coding history. What is the biggest discovery you have found in GitHub?

- In my opinion the greatest discovery I have found in github is forking a repository. this is a rather basic concept but It allows for me to create what I call a Test repository, this allows me to test my code without breaking the file.

### Q, Kaggle datasets for code and science exploration. The avenue of data points us youtube or netflix channels. Analyzing crowd data helps us make decisions. Exam top 10 to 20. Did you see anything interesting?

- Im not sure

## Hacks


### Q1, CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?

- I call my idea "Student Solutions to School Challenges." The idea is to encourage students to come up with innovative and practical solutions to challenges faced in school, such as school safety, bullying, improving the school environment, etc; This crowdsource initiative can empower students to take an active role in improving Del Norte, while also developing critical skills such as problem-solving, collaboration, and leadership.

- We could do this by;
Provide training and resources to help students understand the crowdsource process, including how to develop and present their ideas effectively, Then create an online platform where students can submit their ideas, comment, and vote on each other's submissions.

### Q2, What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?

- This could be a possibility, with my project being an arcade we could implement a commenting system or create a discord to help provide feedback on the games/website. This would allow us to improve our project if open to a large audience which can be easily created through outsourcing our social media.


# 5.5 Legal and Ethical Concerns

### License Communities, License Types Guide

### Q1,When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog.

### A1

- Software licenses and options are agreements between the software creator and the user that dictate how the software can be used, distributed, and modified. The most common types of software licenses MIT, GNU, Etc. With an MIT one must credit your work if they wish to look at it, for a GNU all you information is free to everyone.

- The difference is;
The GNU GPL is explicit about the patent grant an author would be giving when the code (or derivative work) is distributed, the MIT license does not discuss patents. Moreover, the GPL license impacts derivative works, but the MIT license does not.

### Q2, In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic.

### A2

- Software licenses and options are agreements between the software creator and the user that dictate how the software can be used, distributed, and modified. 

- Digital rights refer to the rights of individuals and companies to control the distribution and use of their digital content, including music, videos, software, and other digital media. This often involves the use of digital rights management (DRM) technologies to restrict unauthorized copying and sharing of the content.

- In terms of legal and ethical considerations, it is important to respect the terms of software licenses and to properly attribute the creators of digital content. Failure to do so can result in legal action and damage to one's reputation. 

- When it comes to personal analysis, it is important to consider one's own values and beliefs when making decisions about software licenses and digital rights. Some may prioritize the freedom to modify and share software, while others may value the protection of intellectual property rights.


# 5.6 Safe Computing

### Q1, Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.
### A1; 
Some Personal Identifiable Information that I have seen on github is names, birthdays, and grade.
### Q2, What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure?
### A2;
It's a little weird seeing that anyone can access personal information on me, but Im just not going to give them a reason to.
### Q3, Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.
### A3;
A good Password is something that is long, contains numbers and special keys and is not related to you at all. Bad would be Vice. Another step that can be used in authentication is 2 factor authentication, maybe sending you an email.
### Q4, Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.
### A4;
- Symmetric encryption, also known as shared secret encryption, uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. In other words, the sender and the recipient of the encrypted message both have access to the same secret key and use it to encrypt and decrypt the message.

- Asymmetric encryption, also known as public key encryption, uses two different keys for encryption and decryption: a public key, which is used for encryption, and a private key, which is used for decryption. The public key can be freely shared with anyone, but the private key must be kept secret. The recipient of the encrypted message uses their private key to decrypt the message, while the sender uses the recipient's public key to encrypt it.

### Q5, Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment.
### A5;
In AWS deployment we used SSl encryption. And this encryption uses Symmetric and asymetric encryption.
### Q6, Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.
### A6;
I haven't really "learned the hard way" to my knowledge. However just recently my brother got identity fraud from someone posing as our personal bank, he got $6,000 dollars taken from him.
