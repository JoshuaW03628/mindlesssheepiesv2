## Meet college board criteria:
use data abstraction
use procedural abstraction
show testing
## An first idea, Snake, meets all criteria
- Its Fun to code which causes growth learning, and I can use things learned from app studio and previous students as inspilagerism in order to create.
## My second idea, checkers
- My first idea, checkers, meets all criteria
data abstraction with a 2D array when loading the board and pieces.
procedural abstraction with how the player interacts with the screen and interacts with the pieces on the board.
