# Flowchart

## Quiz

- EQ: What can our questions be to help benefit people in some way
- The quiz needs 3 questions minimum, we plan to divide it into free response,multiple choice, and click all that apply
- possibly adding a score after every question


## Possible Extra

- Pong, we plan to create pong in our app studio if we have enough time


## What is Required

- What is the programs purpose and function
- be able to talk about how the program manages complexity in the context of your own program
- Row 4: Procedural Abstraction
Assesses students’ ability to use abstraction to manage complexity in a program. (Skill Abstraction in Program Development - procedures/functions)
- Row 5: Algorithm Implementation
Assesses students’ ability to implement and apply an algorithm. (Skill Algorithms and Program Development)
- Row 6: Testing
Assesses students’ ability to investigate the situation, context,or task. (Skill Computational Solution Design - testing)

## What the Process actually was

- I started out messing around with keys and trying different things in order to understand the code that i was dealing with.
- Once I was comfortable I first Started out with creating my homepage I decided on my own template and went off of that.
- At this point I was Comfortable with the designs but still needed help with some of the code I was dealing with.
- I asked around and understood what meant what and what went there it led me to creating all of my questions as well as a name page.
- I added a few extra things in to make sure that I was adept with this process and completed any finishing touches.
- Overall this project was fun and I learned some stuff about javascript.

# Design, Successes, and Difficulties 

## Design
- My Design will be pretty unplanned because I don't know how to code especially in JavaScript so I will work with well, whatever works

## Success
- I Was very successful at the design elements labeling, switching screens, images, etc.

## Difficulties
- I had Difficulties With the Results Page but got information from my table allowing me to create it
