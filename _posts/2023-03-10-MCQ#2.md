## Here are the Questions I Have Missed

### Question 30

#### Commentary

The reason that I answered this question incorrectly is because for question #B has the Draw Circle command after the steps to extend the original circle. the answer that I input had it before the translation. Dumb Mistake.

### Question 35

#### Commentary

The reason that I got this incorrect was because, A binary search in a sorted list compares the target value with the average of the list. If this value is not the target value, the search continues from the lower  or  upper half of the list, depending on whether the target value was lower  or higher than the number in the middle of the list.

### Question 41

#### Commentary

The reason I got this incorrect was because, A random statement (1 point out of 10) can give a score of 1, 2, 3, 
, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10. The chance of getting a 1 or 2 is two out of 10, or 20 percent. When this happens, the sum value is increased by 1, simulating a person voting for the candidate.


### Question 46

#### Commentary

The reason I got this incorrect was because, Choosing the best move is an optimization problem that cannot be solved in a reasonable amount of time because the game is slow. If the algorithm for choosing the best move runs too slowly, the game can run faster if heuristics are used to find approximate solutions.
