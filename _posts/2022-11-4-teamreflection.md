## Cool Coders Ava Carlson

This group made a project that would help ASB track their merchandise sales and Cost dependencies. This project was cool and could potentially be a tool for ASB to use in the future.

## Jake Warrens Group

Jakes did very well as a scrum master to make sure to record their process and what their plan layout was. He made a function that records the top 10 artists and songs of the week and in different genre. This project was cool overall and he hit some good topics.

## SLimey Turtles Project

The CSA Slimy Turtles, Im not sure what they created but their Process was cool , they did a similar process to what mr.mort asks of us with bullets and what each member is doing.
