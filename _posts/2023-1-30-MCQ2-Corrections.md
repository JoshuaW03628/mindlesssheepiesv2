The statement Random (1 comma 5) could evaluate to 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. There is a two out of five, or 40 percent, chance that it could evaluate to 1 or 2. If this happens, the value of  sum is increased by 1, which simulates a person voting for the candidate. This does not match the goal of the program, which is to simulate an election in which a certain candidate is expected to receive 20 percent of the vote.
