# Alumni Notes

 - Com-Sci is very egotistical and competitive
 - Focus on your own curve/level
 - I really liked this quote; Theres a Steve Jobs out there beating you 100/100 times so just focus on yourself
 - Google is really resourceful so use it to your advantage
 - Ask Questions to people who know what they're doing, Com-Sci is about finding solutions to a problem it doesn't matter how you get your answer
 - Getting started is a big challenge so just keep your head up.
